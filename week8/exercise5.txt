# EXERCISE DESCRIPTION:
    What is the difference between a physical and a virtual address? Describe using your own words.

# Answer:
  A physical address refers to an actual location in the memory unit. It cannot be viewed by the
  user directly and is computed by Memory Management Unit.
  
  A virtual address, on the other hand, is just a pointer or marker for a memory space that an
  operating system allows a process to use. It can be viewed by the user. Virtual memory is usually
  larger than the physical memory available.
