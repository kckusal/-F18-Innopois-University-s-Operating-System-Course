In program 1, the output is:
    Hello
    Hello
In program 2, the output is:
    Hello
    
The difference in output can be explained by the presence of the newline character inside printf() function
in the first command inside of main() method.

printf() buffers output until a newline is encountered. Program 2, having \n, causes the output buffer to
flush after the first printf() call, and when the fork hits, both processes have an empty buffer.

When we fork the process, the child processes inherits every part of the parent process, including the unflushed output buffer.
When the process terminates, the buffers are flushed. In program 1, we start a total of two processes (including the original
process), and the unflushed buffer will be flushed at the termination of each individual process. Hence, 'Hello' is printed twice.
