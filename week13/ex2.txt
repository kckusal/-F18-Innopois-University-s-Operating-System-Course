â€¢ Theory covered three strategies of dealing with deadlocks: recovery, prevention and avoidance. Explain step by step in which cases one 
  strategy might be better than others.
  
=> When deadlock happens very infrequently and data loss is insignificant, we could ignore deadlocks. But if we have information
about the system resources and can identify situations where deadlock can occur, it is better to detect such deadlocks and apply
the recovery strategy. If, in some situations (for example, a process asking for a busy resource), it is known beforehand that 
taking some action (e.g. granting resource to process) will definitely cause deadlock, it is better to avoid it by not approving
the actions that lead to a deadlock.

However, deadlock avoidance is essentially impossible, because it requires information about future requests, which is not known,
for many real systems. It is better to use prevention strategy if we know that any of the above four conditions stated by Coffman
et al. (1971) can be eliminated.
